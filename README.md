# PHP-REST-API-JS
Attempt at making a RESTful API in PHP and a JS client for it.

#### Details So Far
This is my attempt at making a RESTFul API Server (kinda using MVC with routing) and a client side Javascript to communicate with the server as securly as possible (however SSL is still recommended).

I used a mix of OAuth and HMAC for the API communication. Please let me know if you see any problems with it.
